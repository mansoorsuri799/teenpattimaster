          Wikipedia and rule sites already explain Teen Patti. They do not explain this lobby. Teen Patti Master is where Pakistani players place those rules next to a JazzCash wallet. This article covers hands, the show, and table habits. It is not a deposit tutorial — that lives on the <Link href={ROUTES.deposit} className="text-accent hover:underline">add-money page</Link>.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-accent">Hand ranks you should recite cold</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Trail — three of a kind. Three aces sit at the top.</li>
          <li>Pure sequence — three consecutive cards of one suit.</li>
          <li>Sequence — three consecutive cards, mixed suits.</li>
          <li>Colour — three of a suit that are not in sequence.</li>
          <li>Pair — two matching ranks.</li>
          <li>High card — nothing else connected.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you cannot list that order without opening a note, stay on the lowest table. Raising on a pair because “it looks strong” is how a first wallet disappears.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-accent">Blind play, seen play, and the show</h2>
        <p>
          Blind players have not looked at their cards. Their chaal costs half of a seen chaal. A show cannot start until everyone else has packed and two players remain. A blind show usually costs the current stake. A seen show often costs twice that. If the hands tie, the room rule decides — read the tiny line on the table before you tap Show.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sideshow (comparing with the player who acted before you, while more than two people remain) is a different button. Do not mash Show because the label is in English and you are in a hurry.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-accent">Habits that survive a bad run</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Cap the night in PKR before the first hand, then leave when you hit it.</li>
          <li>Skip Dragon vs Tiger until the Teen Patti order is automatic. Short games spend faster.</li>
          <li>Cash out a win the same evening using the <Link href={ROUTES.withdraw} className="text-accent hover:underline">EasyPaisa exit steps</Link>.</li>
          <li>Do not chase a bonus multiple on tables you do not understand. See the <Link href={`${ROUTES.blog}/${BLOGS[2].slug}`} className="text-accent hover:underline">wagering notes</Link>.</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-accent">Questions this page answers in schema</h2>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-white">When can you ask for a show?</strong> Only with two players left. Blind show ≈ current stake; seen show is often double.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-white">What beats what?</strong> Trail, pure sequence, sequence, colour, pair, high card.
