  },
  {
    q: "Where do I open a ticket if a deposit or cash-out stalls?",
    a: "Start in-app live chat and paste the ticket ID. If chat is closed, use the WhatsApp number printed inside Help — not a number someone DMs you. This page’s FAQ covers the common stalls first.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this APK different from Play Store listings with the same name?",
    a: "This file names JazzCash and EasyPaisa on the Shop screen, keeps Teen Patti next to Dragon vs Tiger and Rummy, and starts the install on teenpattimastergame.com.pk. Play Store and Softonic copies of the title are usually coin-only clones.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Teen Patti Master licensed in Pakistan, and is the file safe to sideload?",
    a: "This site does not quote a public Pakistani gaming licence. Legal status can vary by city. The lobby encrypts login traffic and uses named wallets. Sideloaded APKs can be swapped, so start from this domain, match the gold-frame icon, and stay 18+.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the wallet go to zero in one sitting?",
    a: "Yes. Blind raises, Dragon vs Tiger streaks, and unfinished bonus wagering all drain PKR. Only load an amount you can lose in one evening.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does this website or the APK ship Urdu?",
    a: "This website is English only. After login, Settings may list languages the build actually ships — we do not claim a bilingual site.",
  },
  {
    q: "When does a referral actually credit?",
    a: "Share the in-app referral link. The cut posts after a friend registers and plays. Saving a WhatsApp APK is not enough, and you do not get a second “claim” tap.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there an iPhone build?",
    a: "No. Android APK only. Windows players can run the same file in an emulator — that path is on the PC guide, not an iOS store listing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the usual add and cash-out floors?",
    a: "Shop tiles commonly start around PKR 200. Cash-out to JazzCash or EasyPaisa often starts near PKR 500. Bank-card exits can be larger, often near PKR 20,000 per ticket. Read the Shop and Withdraw screens the day you tap.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is a withdrawal still pending?",
    a: "Unfinished bonus wagering, an unbound number, or a second ticket in the same hour. Wait the 5–30 minute window, then open one live-chat thread with the ticket ID.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Teen Patti Master charge a hidden cash-out fee?",
    a: "This lobby does not add a surprise fee on top of the amount you type. JazzCash or EasyPaisa may still take their own wallet charge. Read the line on the Withdraw screen before you confirm.",
  },
  {
    q: "I forgot the password. What now?",
    a: "On the login screen tap Forgot Password. The OTP goes to the mobile number or email you registered. The full click path is in the account and login guide.",
  },
  {
    q: "Android says App not installed. What did I miss?",
    a: "Delete any older Teen Patti Master or lookalike file, free a few hundred MB, allow unknown apps for the browser you used, and install the APK from this domain again.",

          <div className="space-y-6">
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Teen Patti Master is an Android card-and-table APK centred on Teen Patti, with Dragon vs Tiger, Rummy, and a few faster rooms in the same file. You add PKR through JazzCash or EasyPaisa and send a cash-out to the same method on the number you bound. A first-deposit match, a daily chip drop, and a referral cut sit on top of that wallet — they are not a salary and they are not the ₹3,000 / UPI story published on Indian “official” pages.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Menus stay short: games, wallet, bonuses. Skill tables (Teen Patti, Rummy, poker) sit next to quicker rooms. If you only want a three-card show, you never have to open slots. If you want a two-minute Dragon vs Tiger round, that tile is on the same strip.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-accent">Why Pakistani players pass this APK around</h2>
          <div className="space-y-6">
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              People share it because the wallet names JazzCash and EasyPaisa, the rules for a show are the ones they already know, and the lobby is a card room first. Softonic-style pages that call every Teen Patti Master file “offline fun” are describing a different product.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              One install holds Teen Patti, Dragon vs Tiger, Rummy, poker, and the slots row. Daily chips and a referral cut keep the icon on the home screen. The 38MB package still runs on a lot of Android 5+ phones. Adds and cash-outs stay on the two wallets most Pakistani numbers already have.

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-gray-300">
            <li><strong>Sit at a cheap table first:</strong> Learn when a show is allowed before you raise on a 1,000 PKR seat. The <Link href={`${ROUTES.blog}/${BLOGS[3].slug}`} className="text-accent hover:underline">hand and show guide</Link> covers blind versus seen play.</li>
            <li><strong>Read the wager line on a bonus:</strong> Daily chips and a first-deposit match still need play-through. Do not cash out mid-wager and then blame the ticket.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not chase Dragon vs Tiger to “get even”:</strong> Fast rooms drain a wallet quicker than a patient Teen Patti table.</li>
            <li><strong>Share the referral link, not your password:</strong> Commission posts when friends play. You never need to log in on their phone.</li>
            <li><strong>Collect the daily grant, then stop:</strong> Opening the app every day is fine. Reloading JazzCash every hour is how a first wallet dies.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash out a small test:</strong> After bonus play-through, send PKR 500 to the bound number. A receipt there is the check that matters.</li>
            <li><strong>Use guest chips before cash:</strong> See one show and one Dragon vs Tiger round with free chips if the build still offers them.</li>
            <li><strong>Leave the table when you are angry:</strong> A frustrated raise is not a strategy.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch the pot, not the chat:</strong> Other players’ timing can teach you. Their boasts will not pay your JazzCash.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete a file that does not match this icon:</strong> WhatsApp “old versions” and Softonic clones are the usual theft path.</li>

            Teen Patti Master, started from teenpattimastergame.com.pk, is a real Android lobby with named Pakistani wallets and real ways to lose money. It is not a Play Store clone and it is not a guaranteed income app. Compare the icon, bind your own number, and send a small test cash-out after you clear any wagering line.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            If you want the file, take it from this domain, sit at a cheap Teen Patti table first, and leave when the wallet is no longer money you can afford to lose. 18+ only. This is not a job and not a licensed casino.
