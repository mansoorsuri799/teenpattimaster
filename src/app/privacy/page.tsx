            <p>
              This policy is for the website at {SITE_HOST}, published by {SITE_NAME}. It explains what this site collects when you read guides, open pages, or email support. The Android app has its own in-app notices for login and wallet data. Those notices are not replaced by this page.

              <li>Email address and message text if you write to {SITE_EMAIL}</li>
              <li>Standard server logs: IP address, browser type, pages requested, and time</li>

              We do not ask this website for your JazzCash PIN, CNIC scan, or APK login password. Do not send those in email.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Why we use it</h2>
            <p>
              We use contact mail to answer site questions. We use logs to keep the site up and to see which guides break. We do not sell mailing lists. We may share a log excerpt with a host or security vendor if a request looks like abuse.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              The site may set a small cookie for basic analytics or to remember a dismissed banner. You can block cookies in the browser. Pages will still load.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-3">How long we keep mail</h2>
            <p>
              Support threads are kept long enough to finish the request, then deleted on a routine clean-up unless a legal hold applies in Pakistan.

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Age</h2>
            <p>
              The guides describe a real-money card lobby. They are written for adults 18 and over. If a child contacts us, we delete the message and do not create an account on their behalf.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Your requests</h2>
            <p>
              Email {SITE_EMAIL} to ask what we hold from your messages, or to ask us to delete a thread. We will need enough detail to find the mail. See also the <Link href={ROUTES.contact} className="text-accent hover:underline">contact page</Link>.

            <p>
              When this policy changes, we update the date at the top. Continued use of {SITE_HOST} after that date means you have read the new version.
